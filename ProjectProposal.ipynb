    "   From literature works such as “The Zombie Survival Guide” (Brooks, 2003), to popular TV shows like “The Walking Dead” (FOX, 2010), and movies including “World War Z” (Forster, 2013), the idea of a zombie apocalypse has captivated the attention of millions. Although the concept of an army of undead, semi-sentient, flesh-hungry beings bringing forward the end of humanity may seem like a fantastical notion, there are many experts who argue of the scientific possibility of this grim future. Dr. Peter Cummings, Director of Forensic Neuropathology, argues that being a zombie is similar to two real medical conditions: Klüver–Bucy Syndrome, and encephalitis lethargica (Zombie Research Society). Klüver–Bucy Syndrome’s zombie-mimicking symptoms consist of “visual agnosia (inability to visually recognize objects), loss of normal fear and anger responses, memory loss, distractibility, seizures, and dementia” (NIH, 2018). Encephalitis lethargica, an epidemic that has spread throughout the world between 1915 and 1926, also leads to abnormal, zombie-like behaviors such as “delayed physical and mental response, sleep inversion and catatonia” (NIH, 2018). If these diseases ever become virulent, then it is best that humanity is not caught unprepared.\n",
    "\tA zombie apocalypse cannot occur without the condition becoming an epidemic. As such, following the theory that zombie condition is caused by a virus and can spread, an agent-based model can be used to predict the spread of zombie infections. According to Eubank et al., “agent-based network models designed for infectious diseases have three key components: a realistic synthetic population, social contact network among the individuals in the population, and an appropriate disease model” (2004). Factors that affect this model include population density, age group, elevation, and disease virulency. By creating an agent-based network model that predicts the zombie outbreak, one can find out the best location for surviving the zombie apocalypse.\n",
    "Several groups have tried to predict the spread of zombies based on hypothetical disease models and networks. Hopper, a flight analysis group, has created a map called “The Zombie States of America” that ranks each state based on the likelihood of zombie survival. Factors considered in the company’s analysis include the number of hospitals, gun ownerships, army bases, and Wal-marts (Smith, 2010). The Zombie Research Society, using different parameters, has predicted the top ten countries that are best equipped for zombie survival based on topography, climate, natural resources, and public infrastructure (Howcast, 2013). Using different parameters, the zombie apocalypse can be modeled in many ways, and survivability can change depending on the type of information relevant to the model at hand.\n",

We will use libraries such as pandas and scipy to make sure the distributions are clean and minimize the outliers. We will use the occupied/ vacant data to establish population density for given cities in San Diego which will then affect the dispersion rate of the virus. \n",

    " Our data is public data, which is mostly collected from censuses. Thus, we see no reason it should not be permitted for use in this project, albeit we are certain that this was not the initial intended use of census data. The data is almost entirely numeric, so there is no reason for there to be privacy concerns regarding use of the data, nor will there be terms of use that we need to comply with.\n",
    "    One example of bias that may appear in our data and its survivability analysis is economic differences. For example, if two regions have a similarly low population, we may be lead to believe that they are similar in terms of conditions. However, one locale may be a small, supply-rich, and hilly neighborhood and the other a larger “food desert” with a small, sparse population. In order to do away with this bias, we will be dealing with population density as well as factoring in elevation in our analysis.\n",
    "    Since we are working with population data based on censuses, we expect certain members of San Diego’s population to be underrepresented, which may affect our outcome. Specifically, we expect underrepresentation in census data for undocumented Californian immigrants. According to the Public Policy institute of California’s 2013 data, San Diego County, to the chagrin of the U.S. Republican Party, is a sanctuary-status locale home to 170,500 undocumented immigrants. It is not true that undocumented immigrants are not represented at all in census data, but that their response rate is lower than most other groups. A recent New York Times article[2] acknowledges this and argues that the U.S. census should not add a question regarding citizenship status, as it would lower the response rate of those living  in fear of deportation. While this issue is worth acknowledging, San Diego County has over 3.3 million residents. Thus, we do not feel that the undocumented population (specifically the portion of the 170,500 that do not answer census data) will affect the population distribution of the county significantly enough to affect our results.\n",
    "    If we identify glaring issues or misrepresentation within the data, we will be sure to adjust our analysis accordingly such that it does not affect our overall result of what regions are safest in a zombie epidemic. \n",

    "   The project outlined above will contribute as a realistic model that could predict and anticipate a disease epidemic that mimics zombie-like symptoms in San Diego. As cohorts at UC San Diego, it is essential that we anticipate the progression of a \"zombie apocalypse\" into Southern California so that we may best protect our city and its citizens. In addition, this project could make an interesting addition to media culture surrounding zombies, as it would add a realistic dimension to television shows, movies, and video games. Accompanied by other innovations focusing on increasing the hyper-realistic nature of media such as virtual reality, our simulation can contribute to the new age of technology. \n",
    "\tIf our hypotheses are incorrect, we will continue to improve our model so that it offers a resource to enrich media representation of zombie apocalypse scenarios. One potential pitfall of our methods is that we were unable to account for resources (i.e. water, food, guns), as this variable might influence the spread of the zombie apocalypse. It is likely that we are unable to account for random human behavior or mass hysteria, so this will affect the accuracy of our model, as well. Since our model exclusively accounts for the infection of the zombie disease through direct bites, and fails to account for other forms of infection, our model may not be significantly realistic. \n"
