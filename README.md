**Research Question** 

Where, based on population density, median age, and median housing value, will be the last region in San Diego to be affected by the zombie apocalypse?

**Underlying Assumptions**: 

"The Rules" are an important part of any zombie apocalypse, because every series seems to have different parameters governing their zombies. Our rules are quite simple, partially for simplicity's sake and partially to fit a zombie outbreak to the SIR model for infectious diseases.


1. You become a zombie 24 hours after you are bitten by a zombie.
2. Zombies can only be killed by people, i.e. they do not die of old age or starvation.
3. Zombies cannot be revived. Once they are dead, they are dead.
